## Credit_Risk_Analysis

### Project Overview

We aimed to provide a faster, more reliable loan experience through the use of machine learning models. Using these models, I was able to accurately identify good candidates for loans that could help a financial institution minimize their loan risk. Several machine learning algorithms were developed and evaluated that could predict credit risk.

### Resources
* Dataset:
LoanStats_2019Q1.csv

* Software used:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

Various libraries and algorithms were used to build and evaluate models using resampling including:

1. imbalanced-learn
scikit-learn
RandomOverSampler
SMOTE algorithms
ClusterCentroids algorithm
SMOTEENN algorithm
BalancedRandomForestClassifier (bias reduction model)
EasyEnsembleClassifier (bias reduction model)
